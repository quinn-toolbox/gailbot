## About Gailbot

Gailbot is named after [Gail Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Jefferson), inventor of the transcription system used in [Conversation Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis) transcription system. She can make a first pass at generating a transcript that can then be improved manually.

## How Gailbot works

Gailbot takea a recorded dialogue and uses [Watson's Speech-To-Text system](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) to generate a transcript in the [CHAT transcription format](https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html). It then uses the [Jeffersonize](https://github.com/HiLabTufts/jeffersonize) tool to create a CA-like transcript that includes structural details of the talk such as intra-turn pauses, inter-turn gaps, and overlaps. 

## Status
Gailbot has been tested on MAC OSX.
The current version is an early alpha, feel free to provide feedback at: hilab-dev@elist.tufts.edu

## Before using gailbot

In order to use Gailbot, you should have some familiarity with using the terminal to install and run software. You should also be aware that after a certain amount of free time, IBM's Watson will begin to charge for automated transcription.

## Installation

1. Install the ffmpeg tool:
* Download the tool from: ttps://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
* Intall the tar file on the webpage using the instructions.
* Version required: 4.0.1 or later for Mac OSX.

2. Install the CLAN editor:
* https://talkbank.org/software/

3. Build
Run the following command on the command line to install Gailbot's pre-requisite libraries:
* pip install â€“upgrade Watson-developer-cloud
* pip install pydub

## Usage

Follow these instructions after acquiring the installation process:
* Download or clone the repository, then open the directory with a terminal.
* Use the following command to run gailbot:
* python driver.py -credentials [Bluemix Username]:[Bluemix Password] -files [one or two MXF/Wav file names] -names [One or two speaker names]
* Follow Gailbot's prompts to generate a transcript.

**NOTE:** The Bluemix username and password is required to establish a connection with Watson's Speech to Text service. The user needs to log into the Bluemix account to see their respective credentials for the Speech to Text service: https://idaas.iam.ibm.com/idaas/mtfim/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:basicldapuser

For transcription pricing details see https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text/pricing

**NOTE:** Always copy and paste the custom model ID without punctuation marks when/if propmted by Gailbot.

**File Constraints**
Gailbot currently accepts '.wav' audio files and '.MXF' video files.

##  Custom and Acoustic Language Models:
Gailbot's Custom language model is meant to expand on Watson's existing word dictionary to transcribe specialized contexts. 
Users can add individual words, multiple words, or a corpus text file to the custom model. 
For more details: https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-resource.html#corporaWords

Gailbot's Acoustic language model is meant to train the service to recognize particular sound environments to improve the accuracy of the transcripts.
Currently, Gailbot allows a '.wav' file to train the custom acoustic model.
* The file must be less than 100 MB
* The file length must be greater than 10 minutes and less than 50 hours
* Must be a '.wav' file.
